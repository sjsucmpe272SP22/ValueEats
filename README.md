**Introduction to the problem statement**

The amount of food wasted around the world is so huge and parallely there are many people around the world 
who are suffering due to lack of proper food so we can solve these two issues together with the Valueeats Application.

**Abstract**

Valueeats aims at easy availablity and accessiblity of the untouched leftover food in the restaurants to the needy people.The project aim is to prevent wastage of food and the solution should be quick and at our fingertips because the food would spoil within short period of time. This is achieved by the introduction of digital food vending machines wherein the unused or leftover food from restaurants is loaded by the respective restaurants and the people who are in need of food can collect their desired food items at their nearest Valueeats vending machines.

**Approach**

To create this web application we used HTML,CSS and javascript as frontend Where the admins are responsible for the deployment and maintenance of Vending Machines. Restaurant owners will log into the application and load the food in the Valueeats vending machines and update the loaded food details in the application.This will trigger an email to the registered users in that nearby locality. The application users can login to the application and prebook the desired food items and collect the food in their leisure or they can directly collect the food in person from the vending machines.We used SpringBoot as the backend framework and MySQL for handling the databases.

**Persona(s)**

* **Admin** who is responsible for maintainig the Valueats food vending machines.
* **Restaurant** owners* who should update and load the leftover food in the vending machine.
* **Users** who can collect the food from vending machines.
