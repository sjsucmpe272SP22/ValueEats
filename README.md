<h1>Project Idea -1</h1>

**Title:**

Retrench

**Introduction to the problem statement:**

There is no online site that can single handendly track the prices and discounts of the products availables at local stores. 
This application "Retrench" considers the price of the product at the various local stores, the distance to that stores,
and the average fuel cost to that stores.The outcome is to give the users the lowest cost for a grocery trip.

**Abstract:**

In todayâ€™s world, e-commerce is growing exponentially. We get to buy and sell various products
just by sitting in front of our computers or mobile phones. This helps us save a great deal of time
and money. Many companies are investing a lot in e-commerce to help users get their desired
products with truly little effort. Though it is overwhelming, this is not enough. There are a few
cases where we want to get the product at that point in time, without waiting for a few days for it
to be delivered home. We can achieve this by running up to the local stores to get the product
we need. What if there was a way to get the product from the local stores at the best price? Luckily,
there is a way. This project is all about that.
This project looks for a user's products at the nearby stores and suggests the best possible cost-
effective route to get to the store. Factors consists like distance,fuel cost to travel to
the store, the shortest route to the store, the availability of the product, and the store. All this
makes sense, because imagine a situation where you might want to buy something immediately.
We generally use online search engines to look up where the product might be available.Then we pick the
closest one and go up to the store and finds out that the product is not available.Later we pick
the nearest one from the present location and go up to the next location.We need to  keep running this
loop until you find the product. If we look at the total cost you have spent on the entire journey,
including the fuel, it is huge. To address this very issue, the following project is being introduced.
All we must do is just look for the product in the application and you get the best possible route
to get the product and the local stores, which gives the lowest cost you can spend.

**Approach:**

The applicaiton has a frontend that allows users to register themselves and log into the application.
Once logged in, users can search for the products and add them to their carts. Once they are done
adding, the application shows the suggested routes that have the best cost possible.
We use React.js,Redux and Bootstrap for frontend.
Node.js, Express.js for the backend. MySQL for the databases.

**Persona**

All local stores can use this application to post their products,availability,discounts.
General public can use this application to save on their trips for offline shopping.
