<h1>Project Idea -1</h1>

**Title:**

Retrench

**Introduction to the problem statement:**

There is no online site that can single handendly track the prices and discounts of the products availables at local stores. 
This application "Retrench" considers the price of the product at the various local stores, the distance to that stores,
and the average fuel cost to that stores.The outcome is to give the users the lowest cost for a grocery trip.

**Abstract:**

In todayâ€™s world, e-commerce is growing exponentially. We get to buy or sell various products
just by sitting in front of our computers or mobile phones. This helps us save a great deal of time
and money. Many companies are investing a lot in e-commerce to help users get their desired
products with truly little effort. Though it is overwhelming, this is not enough. There are a few
cases where we want to get the product at that point in time, without waiting for a few days for it
to be delivered home. We can achieve this by running up to the local stores to get the product
we need. What if there was a way to get the product from the local stores at the best price? Luckily,
there is a way. This project is all about that.
This project looks for a user's products at the nearby stores and suggests the best possible cost-
effective route to get to the store. It considers many factors like distance, the fuel cost to get to
the store, the shortest route to the store, the availability of the product, and the store. All this
makes sense, because imagine a situation where you might want to buy something immediately.
You use online search engines to look up where the product might be available. You then pick the
closest one and go up to the store and finds out that the product is not available. You then pick
the nearest one from the present location and go up to the next location. You keep running this
loop until you find the product. If we look at the total cost you have spent on the entire journey,
including the fuel, it is huge. To address this very issue, the following project is being introduced.
All we must do is just look for the product in the application and you get the best possible route
to get the product and the local stores, which gives the lowest cost you can spend.

**Approach:**

The project has a frontend that allows users to register themselves and log into the application.
Once logged in, users can search for the products and add them to their carts. Once they are done
adding, the application shows the suggested routes that have the best cost possible.
We use React.js,Redux and Bootstrap for frontend.
Node.js, Express.js for the backend. MySQL for the databases.

**Persona**

All local stores can use this application to post their products , availability,discounts.
General public can use this application to save on their trips for offline shopping.


<h1>Project Idea -2: </h1>

**Title**

Valueeats

**Introduction to the problem statement**

The amount of food wasted around the world is so huge and parallely there are many people around the world 
who are suffering from food so we can solve these two issues with the Valueeats Application.

**Abstract**

Valueeats is defined by the distribution of unused food and the provision of assistance to those in need.
The project aim is to prevent food waste, which was a huge issue that needed to be 
addressed.The solution should be quick and at our fingertips because the food would expire in a short period of 
time. Today, there is an application for almost any problem, and applications have become the most popular 
trend in recent years. The main concept of this app is, the untouched leftover food in the restaurants should be 
distributed to the needy people. 

**Approach**

To create this web application we need HTML,CSS and javascript as frontend Where the users will be logged into the application and
can order the food based on the availability and in the sameway restaurant admin will have all the details of food which is left over, we store it in a 
database using MYSQL and notify this information to the distributors.First restaraunt owners and distributors should create their account.
Based on the user request distributors can react accordingly.

**Persona(s)**

Restaurant owners who should update the leftover food in the application,Users who should login to the application 
and order the food and the distributors who takes requests of the users and deliver the food to them.
