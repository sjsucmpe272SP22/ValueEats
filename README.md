Valueeats

**Introduction to the problem statement**

The amount of food wasted around the world is so huge and parallely there are many people around the world 
who are suffering due to lack of proper food so we can solve these two issues with the Valueeats Application.

**Abstract**

Valueeats aims at easy availablity and accessiblity of the untouched leftover food in the restaurants to the needy people.The project aim is to prevent wastage of food, 
which is a huge issue that needs to be addressed.The solution should be quick and at our fingertips because the food would spoil within short period of 
time. This is achieved by the introduction of digital vending machine wherein the unused or leftover food particularly from restaurants is loaded by the respective restaurants and the people who are in need of food can collect their desired food items at their nearest Valueeats vending machines.

**Approach**

To create this web application we need HTML,CSS and javascript as frontend Where the restaurants will be logging into the application and load the food in the Valueeats
vending machines and update the loaded food details in the application.This will trigger an email to the registered users in that nearby locality. The application users can login to the application and prebook the desired food items and collect the food in their leisure or they can directly collect the food in person from the vending machines.
We will be using MySQL for handling the databases and nodejs(express) for the backend API.

**Persona(s)**

Admin who is responsible for maintainig the Valueats vending machines.
Restaurant owners who should update and load the leftover food in the vending machine.
Users who can collect the food from vending machines.
